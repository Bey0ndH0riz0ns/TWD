# The Winds of Daemons


Welcome to the companion repository for the interactive visualization project called 'The Winds of Daemons,' whose Tableau online visualization is found here. This visualization aims to enable computer scientists, software developers, and data scientists to analyze for decision-making purposes the global common category, historical trends, category correlations, and category popularity using the annual Stack Overflow surveys from 2011 to 2022. To make this visualization trustworthy and enable other interested people to embark on similar visualization challenges, we will go through the faced challenges, compromise solutions, and related material of this project.


## How to use the workbook


Assuming you have Tableau installed, open the workbook and unhide all charts by right-clicking the dashboards (the colored tabs) and left-clicking the 'Unhide all sheets' option. This allows you to see how these charts were made and what calculations they used.


## Problems


The integration of 11 online survey datasets with different amounts of rows and questions creates the following problems:


- Questionable explanatory power of self-identified answers
- Identification of relevant questions from many questions
- The changing format between datasets
- The large size of the dataset
- Different labels for the same data
- Multi-choice questions
- The potential effects of missing answers


Here is an example of the first problem:
