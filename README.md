# The Winds of Daemons

Welcome to the companion repository for the interactive visualization project called 'The Winds of Daemons,' whose Tableau online visualization is found here. This visualization aims to enable computer scientists, software developers, and data scientists to analyze for decision-making purposes the global common category, historical trends, category correlations, and category popularity using the annual Stack Overflow surveys from 2011 to 2022. To make this visualization trustworthy and enable other interested people to embark on similar visualization challenges, we will go through the faced challenges, compromise solutions, and related material of this project.
